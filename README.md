2. select the output directory.
3. press 'Parse and Index' button and patiently wait until a pop window will be shown to the screen. this pop screen will contain            information regarding the corpus processing. the inforamtion will contain:

   - total process time (seconds)
   - total process time (minutes)

* if you are trying to open the project in Intellij, makesure you auto enable maven updates to properly download all the dependencies.
